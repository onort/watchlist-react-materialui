### [Live Demo](https://react-materialui-watchlist.firebaseapp.com/)

For demo app you can create an account with an email and 6 characters password, or simply login to demo account with email `demo@demo.com` and pasword `demo1234`.

This is a single page watchlist app built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) as challange to create a React App without a state management library (which prove to be very hard to endure) and a learning project for Material UI.
